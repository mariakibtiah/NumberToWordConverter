The Reason i choose razor because it is lightweight, web page framework.

Number Converter solution:
The solution i choose is my create few enums:
1. BelowTwenty
2. Tens
3. Thousand

The reason i choose for Enum compared to array because enum is lighter than array and also i can have clean code.

the class call NumberConverterService is the core method to process the input

I also create Unit test to test the possibility of the error.(NumberConverterServiceTests)
